## How to Contribute

We follow a simple workflow to keep contributions organized:

### 1. **Start with an Issue**
- **Before writing code**, open an issue on GitHub to discuss your idea
- For bug reports: describe the problem, steps to reproduce, and expected behavior
- For features/improvements: explain the problem you're solving and your proposed solution
- For questions: ask away!

### 2. **Wait for Feedback**
- A maintainer will review your issue and provide feedback
- This ensures your contribution aligns with the project's direction
- Avoids wasted effort on changes that won't be merged

### 3. **Fork and Branch**
- Fork the repository
- Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `fix/bug-description`
- Use descriptive branch names

### 4. **Make Your Changes**
- Write clean, self-documenting code
- Follow our commit message guidelines below
- Add tests if applicable
- Ensure pre-commit hooks pass

### 5. **Submit a Pull Request**
- Reference the issue number in your PR description (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- Provide a clear description of what changed and why
- Keep PRs focused on a single issue/feature

### 6. **Review Process**
- Respond to feedback promptly
- Make requested changes in new commits (don't force-push during review)
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR

## Commit Message Guidelines

We prioritize self-documenting code and meaningful commit messages. Code should clearly express **what** it does, while commit messages explain **why**.

### Format

```
<type>: <brief summary>

<detailed explanation>
- Why was this change necessary?
- What problem does it solve?
- What alternatives were considered?
```

### Types
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `refactor:` Code restructuring
- `perf:` Performance improvement
- `docs:` Documentation
- `test:` Tests
- `chore:` Maintenance

### Example
```
refactor: Replace nested loops with hash map in findDuplicates

The O(n²) approach was causing timeouts on large datasets.
HashMap provides O(1) lookups and reduces execution time
from 2.3s to 45ms on 10k items.

Refs: #156
```

### Code Documentation Rules

**Avoid:**
- Comments restating obvious code
- Commented-out code (use git history)
- Vague TODOs and FIXMEs without context

**Include:**
- Why non-obvious decisions were made
- Complex business logic explanations
- Known limitations or edge cases
- Public API documentation
- Complex algorithms or patterns

## Respect & Kindness
- Be kind and polite.
- Listen to others and assume good intent.
- Disagree with ideas, not with people.

---

That's it. Let's keep things simple, safe, and respectful while building together.
