### UI
a ZERO CLIC UI is the public view of laiive
1st phase:  MVP minimal viable product, streamlit easy app or similar (python base)
2nd phase: jump into React frontend

### RAG-chat
With a simple UI this is the backbone of laiive, high accuracy on retrievals from the knwoledge database is a must
1st phase: with llama-index just session id, no user id. just serving info, not extracting info from conversations
2nd phase. + user id

### Event Scraper
First feed to the db, until the pusher will the main data source and the system is ready to switch
The transition will be based on geographic penetration.

### Pusher-Extractor
Easy is the keyword, the most easy way to push and confirm your event data.
Optimized for reliability. A reliable database serves reliable answers.

### Data
laiive deals with ephimeral data, data that still doesn't exist, laiive is a dynamic process, that grows in inertia when users use it and promoters push events.
A Postgres db is the heart of this dynamics and stores all the system knowledge.
