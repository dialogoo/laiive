![mission](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/569506fc-6adb-4762-8b60-2f2e0bb69866)

#### why 🫦laiive makes sense?

laiive was born to connect small events with people close to them, laiive does not focus on big musical events as many platforms are, laiive works on the human and community scale where small music events live.

#### why is 🫦laiive good?

laiive was born as an AI cultural agenda, with the AI hype and AI competition without the AI Safety layer laiive has become a subversive way of using AI, it tries to steal attention from the main digital platforms and bring it back to real world social meetings. laiive positions itself as an ethical AI app helping to develop a balanced digital-physical culture before the intermediate layer in our digital comunication becomes too powerful.

#### why is 🫦laiive profitable?

laiive is a catalyzer of a world wide business that is actually unatended. laiive connects thousands of daily live events and millions of people are not going to them because they don't know they exist. Who is willing to pay for laiive services? I am sure you have arrived to the same conclusion than I ;)

### UI
a ZERO CLIC UI is the public view of laiive, easy to publish an event, easy to find an event.

### Retriever Agent
The backbone of laiive, an agent-based retrieval system with high accuracy on retrievals from the Neo4j knowledge graph database. The retriever uses an orchestrator pattern with specialized agents:
- **Orchestrator**: Routes queries and manages conversation flow
- **DBQueryAgent**: Generates and executes Neo4j Cypher queries using LLM
- **SafetyGuard**: Validates queries and enforces safety constraints
- **Neo4jClient**: Handles graph database connections and query execution

Currently supports session-based queries. User ID support planned for future phases.

### Pusher Agent
Multimodal event ingestion service that receives submissions (text/image/audio), runs router + extraction + guardrails + HITL (Human-In-The-Loop) validation. The system takes care of reliability and data quality through automated validation and human review workflows.

### Event Scraper (Legacy)
Legacy service for initial data feed. Located in `legacy/services/scraper/`. The pusher agent will become the main data source as the system transitions based on geographic penetration.

### Data Strategy
laiive deals with ephemeral data, data that still doesn't exist. laiive is a systemic platform that generates dynamic processes, it grows in inertia when users use it and promoters push events. Neo4j graph database is the heart of this dynamics and stores all the system knowledge, enabling natural relationship queries between events, artists, venues, and users.

### instructions

#### Development Setup in devcontainer (recommended)

1. Open the devcontainer: (instructions for VScode)
   ```bash
   # From the root directory
   code .
   # Then click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
   ```
   alternatively Ctrl+shift+P "DevContainer: Rebuild and reopen in Container"

2. Navigate to desired service directory and install dependencies (once inside the devcontainer):
   ```bash
   cd services/<service-name>
   uv sync  # Install Python dependencies using uv
   ```
   alternatively use the Makefile command
   ```bash
   make deps
   ```

3. The containers start automatically, but to run the actual services:
   ```bash
   make run-dev  # Start frontend and backend services
   ```

4. Open localhost:3001 and localhost:8001 to check or use the services ports. (they are maped from port 3000 to port 3001 and from port 8000 to port 8001 in the devcontainer)


#### Production Setup (it build and runs all the services at once)

1. Go to the root directory and run:
   ```bash
   make up-prod
   ```
